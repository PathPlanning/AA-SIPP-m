# AA-SIPP(m)
It's a prioritized planner, e.g. all agents are assigned unique priorities and paths are planned one by one in accordance with the imposed ordering using AA-SIPP (any-angle SIPP) algorithm. The latter builds on top of the SIPP planner, which is tailored to path finding for a single agent moving amidst static and dynamic obstacles (other agents in this case).

Videos folder contains a few video demonstrations of how AA-SIPP(m) works.

Instances.zip contains all the tasks on which the results of the experimental evaluation were obtained in the ICAPS-2017 paper, which is publically available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04159.pdf
